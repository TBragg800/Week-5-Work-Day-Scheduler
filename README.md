### Psuedo Code:
* Needs div for each hour.
* Each hour div needs a class to ref all hour divs and an id or class to ref individually.
* Each hour div needs a button with "saveBtn" class and maybe a class to access all buttons "btn".
* Use moment.js to incorporate and format date and time
* Current day and time must be appear in the jumbotron
* Hour must start at 9.
* Statements to handle if hour is past, present or future.
  * Might be able to write code to handle each hour in one code???
  
* Choose which method to use to get items from local storage. getItem() appears the easiest.
